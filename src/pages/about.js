        I like to make beautiful sites and their mobile versions. I pay special attention to functionality, usability and appearance. I think that a small departure from the strict canons of layout is quite acceptable for the sake of external "pleasantness" and ergonomics, especially for tablet versions and mobile applications. And I really love coffee;)
